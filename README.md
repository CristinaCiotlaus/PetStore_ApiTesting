# PetStore_ApiTesting
API testing with Postman on https://petstore.swagger.io/

The Petstore Swagger API is a RESTful web service that provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on pets, implemented using the OpenAPI Specification. 
It allows one to manage pets, including adding new pets, updating their information, retrieving details about individual pets, and deleting pets. 
The API is explored here through the Swagger UI interface.
